"""Constrained aligner for English spelling and phoneme sequences.

Given a word, its phoneme sequence, and a GPC inventory, ``parse_gpcs``

    Takes one ``Pronunciation`` — a phoneme sequence together with the
    word-shape facts derived from its ARPABET source, such as
    ``is_monosyllabic``. Callers hold several per word and should try each,
    accepting a match on any one.

    A parse is a tuple of ``GPCMatch`` objects that together cover every
    letter of the spelling and every phoneme in the sequence. Multiple
    parses arise when the inventory offers overlapping ways to cover the
    same span — ``fish`` decomposes as ``f + i + sh`` (via ``sh → /ʃ/``)
    and as ``f + ish`` (via ``ish → (ɪ, ʃ)``), both yielding /f, ɪ, ʃ/.

    Beyond ordinary contiguous matches, the parser handles:

    - Split graphemes (``a-e``, ``i-e``, …): the two parts cover
      non-adjacent letter positions, with the gap bounded by
      ``max_split_gap``.
    - Edge-marked units (``-ed``, ``-ing``, ``pre-``, ``un-``, ``-ve``,
      ``-le``): affixes and positional graphemes taught as chunks. The
      marker is stripped from ``symbol`` and recorded on the ``GPC``
      (``is_prefix``/``is_suffix``); suffix markers do not constrain
      matching — the same chunk appears medially in inflected words
      (``gives``, ``tables``) — while prefix units anchor to the word
      start (``pre-`` in ``predict``, not ``re-`` inside it).
    - Free pass on unstressed vowels: a bare vowel letter paired with
      an unstressed phoneme parses via a synthesized ``REDUCED_*`` GPC —
      vowel reduction is a universal spoken-English process, not a taught
      correspondence. Withheld when the pronunciation is monosyllabic: a
      one-syllable word has no unstressed syllable to reduce into, so its
      vowel is a correspondence the student has to have been taught.
      The same reduction applies inside the yod correspondence: where the
      inventory licenses ``u → (j, u)``, a bare ``u`` paired with /j/ plus
      an unstressed vowel parses via ``REDUCED_YOD_U`` — the /j/ glide is
      part of the taught correspondence and only its vowel reduces
      (``partic-u-larly`` /j ə/).
    - Silent apostrophe: ``'`` positions are skipped without consuming
      a phoneme (``he's`` decodes as ``h + e + s``) — the curriculum
      treats possessive/contracted ``'s`` as an assumed correspondence.
    - Shared letters: a grapheme may reuse one boundary letter already
      claimed by a neighboring grapheme — either its first letter reusing
      the previous match's last letter (``jungle``: ``ng → ŋ`` *and*
      ``g → g`` share the ``g``), or its last letter sitting on a split
      digraph's reserved tail (``placed``: the ``e`` is the ``a-e`` tail,
      part of ``ce → s``, and part of ``-ed → t``). Interior positions
      must still be unclaimed; phonemes are never shared.
